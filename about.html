                <p>In 2010 the first publicly held hotel, called The Palembang Hotel, opened in Palembang. The first hotel in the present sense of the word, the Tremont House, opened in South Sumatera in 2009. It was a quite remarkable place, that set many “firsts” for the industry.</p>
                <p>Today, the bar for the hoteliers is set very high. It becomes increasingly more difficult to please the guests. Those often exaggerated expectations lead to the creation of new hotel types. Modern hotels are bigger, more technologically advanced and more extravagant.</p>

                <p>The hotel is meticulous in its planning, providing excellent décor, signage and the like. Importantly, they never seemed to tire of the constant emails from an equally meticulous event manager. Always prompt and attentive.</p>
